# üíßüó∫Ô∏è Dhulikhel Water Supply System Optimization using Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)


This project focuses on optimizing the water supply network in Dhulikhel by applying **Kruskal's algorithm** to determine the **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**. The goal is to minimize the cost of constructing and maintaining the water distribution network while ensuring efficient connectivity between different locations. üöÄ

We've explored two approaches:

1.  **Distance-based MST:** Utilizing geographical coordinates to calculate distances between potential water supply nodes.
2.  **Population-based MST:** Considering the population of each area as a factor in the network optimization.

This repository contains the Python scripts used to calculate distances, implement Kruskal's algorithm (through the **networkx** library), and visualize the resulting MST on a graph.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Files

This repository includes the following key files:

* `graphdraft.py`: A Tkinter-based application that allows users to input edges and weights to visualize a graph and its Minimum Spanning Tree using Kruskal's algorithm.
* `haversine.py`: A script that calculates the pairwise Haversine distances between various locations in Dhulikhel based on their latitude and longitude. It then displays these distances in a table using Matplotlib.
* `population.py`: A script that calculates the absolute difference in population between different locations in Dhulikhel and displays these "population distances" in a table using Matplotlib.

## üó∫Ô∏è Distance-Based MST

The `haversine.py` script calculates the geographical distances between the following locations:

* Devitar
* Rabigaun
* Dhulikhel
* Bakhundol
* Shreekhandapur
* Bhagwatisthan
* Narayansthan
* Bhattedanda
* Kavrebhanjyang
* Sharada Batase
* Patlekhet
* Shankhu Patichaur

These distances can be used as edge weights in a graph to find the MST, representing a cost-effective water pipeline network based on proximity.

## üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Population-Based MST

The `population.py` script calculates the difference in population between the same locations. While not a traditional distance, this could represent a "demand" factor, where connecting areas with similar populations might have logistical advantages.

## üí° Learnings

* Apply graph theory concepts, specifically the Minimum Spanning Tree.
* Implement Kruskal's algorithm using the `networkx` library.
